One last try.
I'm giving life one last try.
Good morning, Mr.
Dempsey.
Morning.
My name is Dennis Vasquez, representing Andrew and Olivia Baker, and this is a deposition.
I'll be asking you questions, and you must answer them truthfully unless your attorney clearly instructs you otherwise.
- Do you understand? - Yes.
There's no judge present, but this is a formal legal proceeding.
You are under the same legal obligation to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
Do you understand? Yeah, I understand.
Okay, good.
Uh, for the record, please state your full name, your age, where you go to school, and what year you're in.
I'm, uh My name is Zachary Shan-Yung Dempsey.
I'm 17, and I'm a junior at Liberty High.
And when and where did you first meet Hannah Baker? I met her at a party, I guess, right before sophomore year started.
And how well did you know Hannah? Um I didn't know her that well at all.
I mean, I knew her from around school, I guess, and she, um she dated my friend Justin for a while.
Are you aware of anyone bullying Hannah? Dennis, we're going to object.
That asks him to qualify behavior.
Did you ever hear anyone say unkind things to Hannah? Um Yes.
Yeah, I heard, and, um and I said some things myself.
Hey.
There you go.
As requested.
And it just, like the tapes in my parents' store, it just records on them? Yeah, like a voice text on your iPhone, only with way more style.
May I ask what the project is? Just this stupid thing.
- Do you mind if I keep it for a few days? - Keep it as long as you like.
I'll see you in fifth? - Yeah, see you.
Thank you.
- Yeah.
I recorded 12 tapes.
I started with Justin.
Then Jessica.
Who each broke my heart.
- Hey.
It's Hannah.
Hannah Baker.
- Alex, Tyler, Courtney, Marcus, who each helped destroy my reputation.
Did you just? It's real tight.
On through Zach and Ryan who broke my spirit.
Through tape number 12 Bryce Walker who broke my soul.
But a funny thing happened as I finished number 12.
I felt something shift.
I had poured it all out and for a minute just a minute I felt like maybe I could beat this.
I decided to give life one more chance.
But this time, I was asking for help because I know I can't do it alone.
I know that now.
Good morning.
Good morning, sunshine.
- You look radiant today.
- I do not.
I need one more cassette for my project.
Is it okay if I just grab it? Yeah, go ahead, sweetie.
Anything you need.
Just put it down on the inventory, which no one bothers to look at - when they call the distributor anyway.
- I told you, they only allow for Of course, if you're listening to this, I failed.
Or he failed, and my fate is sealed.
Okay, Mom, I'm off.
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.
Hey.
When do we get to hear about this project? You don't.
It's stupid.
Don't even worry.
Nothing you do is stupid.
I mean it.
Okay, uh Mom, please.
No.
- I have to go.
- All right.
I love you.
Thank you.
Have a good day.
Thank you! Lorene will be here any minute.
She's good to work all day.
But are you sure you want to sit through these? Dennis says they're just mostly procedural at this point.
I'm sure.
We should both be there.
Someone has to meet the realtor at the house this afternoon.
We'll reschedule.
We have to get the house listed this month.
We'll reschedule.
I don't know it's necessary for us to be at every deposition.
I do.
Those kids hurt our daughter.
I want to find out what they know.
Hannah and me, we'd have a conversation now and then.
Did you ever date Hannah? No.
I mean, we had a milkshake once.
It was just a Dollar Valentine's thing.
Hannah didn't take it seriously? - Objection.
- I'll rephrase.
Um, did Hannah ever say anything to you that might lead you to believe that she did take it seriously? Not really.
I-I think I think I might have been I might have hurt Hannah's feelings a little bit.
But I didn't mean to.
Hurt her feelings how? I thought she wanted to date me.
She didn't.
Are you giving me the silent treatment, or is it the other way around? Shouldn't it be the other way around? - I'm just eating breakfast.
- You disappeared again.
There are consequences when you disappear.
I didn't disappear, for fuck's sake.
I was at a friend's house.
A friend who beat you senseless? I told you, I wiped out on my bike.
What, did you land on Mike Tyson? Look who just pulled up outside.
Tony.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Thought Tony might like to join us for breakfast.
We can all catch up.
Maybe talk about your depositions tomorrow.
- That would be great.
- Tony doesn't have time.
Upstairs.
Clay.
Mom, soon.
I promise.
Hey, what the fuck happened to your face? I'll show you.
This couldn't wait till after school? Copy this tape.
I'll get it from you after homeroom.
- I already have copies.
- No.
Remember how side "B" was blank? Yeah.
It's not blank anymore.
She wanted me.
Me.
She was practically begging me to fuck her.
If that's rape, then every girl at this school wants to be raped.
He fucking confessed.
No.
You didn't give him the tapes, did you? I gave him the gist of his.
I'm assuming you want to make a copy of that to keep your set complete.
And then what? Sheri texted me last night.
She went to the police herself.
- What happened? - I don't know.
But if she's facing up to it, and we have Bryce's confession What about going through the cycle like Hannah wanted? It's time we stop thinking about what Hannah wanted and start thinking about what she needs.
And Jessica.
And every other girl who "practically begged" Bryce to fuck her.
I gotta tell you, Clay, I am not sure that this is the right thing to do, and even if I was, I don't know where we stand.
We can't be righteous.
We've been sitting on evidence for weeks.
Either we do something now, or we give it up tomorrow in that deposition.
There are half a dozen kids going in there today.
Who knows what happens with them.
This tape This tape blows up the world.
Which is what we should do, don't you think? Did you consider Hannah a friend? Not really.
An acquaintance would be more accurate.
Reporter, can you mark this document as Exhibit three.
Can you tell me who this is in this photo? It's hard to tell.
That's not you in this photo? I thought we were here to talk about Hannah.
I'm not sure what you're trying to pin on my daughter Mr.
Crimsen, you're here as a courtesy.
Your daughter is 18.
She can talk about this photo now, or do it in court.
Thank you for meeting me.
You were the only one who tried to tell me the truth.
Are you I promised myself that I wasn't going to say something stupid like "are you okay" or "how are you doing," because, like, how the fuck do you think, right? But how are you? How the fuck do you think? Yeah.
Do you need to talk to somebody? See somebody? Who? I'll burn these.
I'll light them on fire and let them burn until they're I don't know, melted plastic and ash.
It's your call.
But if you want to fight if you want him to pay you for what he did, these tapes can help.
They're proof.
You want me to tell the whole goddamn world what happened to me? I want you to do what you want to do.
Whatever's going to make this better for you, if anything can.
But I'm not gonna lie.
I want him to pay for what he did.
Will he, though? I mean have you listened to the last tape? You know what happens when girls try to get help? I listened to the last tape.
And I think I should pass the tapes on like Hannah wanted.
I'd have to tell the police, I'd have to tell my dad.
Yeah.
I don't think I can do that.
Okay.
You think I'm letting Hannah down.
I think we all let Hannah down.
And I think she let you down.
So Thanks for talking to me about this.
And I guess let me know if there's anything if there's anything.
Clay.
Don't burn the tapes.
Look.
The jocks, they walk the halls like they own the place.
The teachers feed into it.
Bolan feeds into it.
It's just it's how it is.
But you dated athletes.
Objection.
Relevance.
She's here to talk about Hannah Baker.
Yeah.
Of course I dated jocks.
There are decent jocks, you just gotta learn how to find them.
Hannah never learned.
It's not her fault.
I mean you try going to school with a bunch of Neanderthals who are told they are the only thing of value at school, and that the rest of us are merely there to cheer them on and provide them with whatever support they need.
So, you texted Hannah more than once that she had terrible taste in guys.
What did you mean? What I meant what I mean is that, if I hadn't moved away if I hadn't let her start dating Justin if I'd been around to help her through it she'd still be alive today.
And Justin is Justin Foley? Yes.
Justin is Justin Foley.
Are you and Justin still friendly? Justin Foley is dead to me.
Jesus Christ, are you following me? I have to talk to you.
- Justin! - Jess, please.
I I've been walking around all night.
I've got no place to live, okay? Shit Shit's so fucked up.
You think? - Just talk to me.
- Why, Justin? Why should I talk to you? Last night, I I walked every street in this shitty-ass town.
And I ended up by the water, by the docks.
I climbed up this crane, all the way up there, and I could I could see the whole city.
And I was gonna jump.
Or shoot myself.
But I couldn't.
Because I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I can't stop.
Try harder.
Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
I'll fucking go to the school.
I'll talk to the cops.
I'll kill Bryce.
If you want, I'll kill him with my bare hands and pay the price.
Just please tell me what you want.
What I want is never to see you again in my life.
All I'm saying is if you throw like you threw in divisionals last year, we'll be fine.
Yeah.
I'll be fine.
Never be Jeff Atkins, though.
I fuckin' miss that guy.
He was a good dude.
Aah! Fuck! Shake it off, man.
It's just rust.
Nah, I fucked up my hand last night.
Jesus! Who'd you hit? Ah, just the wall.
You gotta watch that temper, bro.
You telling me to watch my temper is like Justin Foley telling me to lay off the weed.
Where is that guy, anyway? No clue.
You figure your shit out? From the other night? Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, we're good.
All right, let's go.
A few days after I recorded tape 12, I saw Bryce in the hallway.
And congrats to our Liberty Tigers on their first win of the season! Game ball goes to Bryce Walker, 12 catches and two touchdowns! I thought I could never show my face at that school again.
Everything was dark for days.
But then just a little flash of light.
A flash of light, and you think, maybe I feel like, as a society, our priorities are all out of whack, you know? Yeah.
Clay What? Never mind.
I'll see you in Bradley's.
Mr.
Porter.
Clay.
What happened? Are you all right? Yeah, no, I'm fine.
It's just I know I'm still on suspension, but I I needed to talk.
Is that okay? Yeah, sure.
Come on.
I was glad to see you on my calendar.
Why? I'm just glad you made an appointment to come talk.
So, uh what's on your heart today? Well, uh just everything, I guess.
Okay, every everything, huh? Everything is a lot.
Why don't we start with how you're feeling right now.
Right now? Yeah.
Right now.
Lost.
I guess.
Sort of empty.
Empty? Yeah, I don't feel anything.
Like I don't care anymore.
You don't care about what? About anything.
School.
Myself.
The people here.
My parents.
Your parents? I mean, I care about them, but I'm not I'm not who they need me to be.
Well, who do they need you to be? Not a problem.
Really? Well, how are you a problem to them? I don't know.
You can get that if you want.
Uh, no.
No, uh Listen, what about your friends? Do you care about them? Friends? What friends? Now, I know you have friends.
I see you in the halls.
Yeah, well Jessica Davis.
Alex Standall.
And I've seen you around with Courtney Crimsen.
They're not my friends.
What about Clay Jensen? Clay Jensen hates me.
Clay.
Clay.
So what's on your mind today? I wanted to talk about Hannah Baker.
She pushed me away.
I was thinking about how hurt I was, and I didn't even for a minute stop to think that she was hurting too.
Look, Clay whatever happened to Hannah, between you and her, with other kids, she made that choice to take her own life.
But why? Why did she make that choice? We can't know that for sure.
What if we could? What if we knew what we did wrong? I don't think Clay Jensen hates you.
I don't know him all that well, but he doesn't seem the type to hate anyone.
It's like it doesn't even matter what you say.
Maybe it does.
I don't know.
Okay, I'm not following you.
You know what? Never mind.
Wait, hang on.
Don't go.
Just Just help me out here.
Please.
When you leave this office how would you like things to be different for Hannah? I don't know.
I I'm not sure what I'm expecting.
All right.
Well, it sounds like there's something that you need that you're not getting.
So, let's start there.
I need it to stop.
You need what to stop? I need everything to stop.
Just People.
Life.
Life? You know, it's natural to blame yourself, but we all do the best we can.
I think that's bullshit.
I think we should blame ourselves.
I think we all could do better.
We can try to love each other better, but we're imperfect people.
We love imperfectly.
We don't always get it right.
How can you just live with that? I mean, you're a counselor.
I have to live with it.
You can know all the signs and understand the issues, and still come up missing something.
That's not good enough.
What about the next kid who wants to kill himself? Do you think about hurting yourself? The other night, I almost threw myself off a cliff.
I'm glad you didn't.
You may not feel that way in a minute.
Why do you say that? Hannah Baker came to see you the day she died.
Hannah.
What did you mean when you said you needed life to stop? I don't know.
'Cause that seems like a very serious thing to say.
I know.
I I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that, I guess.
So what happened, Hannah? How did you get here? Just one thing on top of another.
If I'm gonna help you, I'm gonna need you to be a little more specific.
I'm sure you've heard some of the rumors about me.
I haven't, actually.
What do these rumors say? Last year, I was voted actually, not voted.
Someone made this stupid list.
"Best of, worst of" thing.
And people have been reacting to it ever since.
When was the last time? A week ago.
At a party.
What happened at the party? She told you what happened to her.
Look, even if she did come to visit me this is not something I can talk about.
So, if I tell you that I'm going to kill myself, you can't tell anyone? Yes, I can tell your parents.
You know, I can tell who I need to tell in order to get you the right medical attention.
Did you tell anyone about Hannah? Hannah never told me she was thinking about killing herself.
- But you did see her.
- I didn't say that.
You saw her.
And she told you things were bad.
That she didn't care about anything, that she wanted everything to stop.
When did you talk to her last? She told you how she got to that point.
Was there Did you have an encounter at the party? An encounter? Yeah, you could say that.
Did You don't want to talk about this.
No, I do.
Listen, Hannah, I'm not gonna judge you but did anything happen that night that you regret? Yes.
Are you embarrassed by what happened? Yes.
Maybe you made a decision? No, I A decision to do something with a boy that now you regret.
Oh, my God, no! That's just what you assume? No, I'm just asking you.
I didn't make a decision.
Okay.
Sorry.
Um Did anything happen at the party that may be considered illegal? Maybe.
- Alcohol? - Yeah, but I wasn't drinking.
Drugs? Not that I know of.
Did he force himself on you? I think so.
You think so? But you're not sure.
Did you tell him to stop? No.
Did you tell him no? No.
Maybe you consented, then changed your mind.
No, it's not like that! Should we involve your parents or the police? No! Hannah, who's the boy? Who's the boy? She couldn't give you a name.
She didn't use the word, but she described the rape.
- Again, I can't - I know you can't.
So let's talk about a hypothetical student who says she was raped but won't say who did it, or can't.
When a student is assaulted, I'm required to go to the police.
But I need to know exactly what happened, and who did it.
If I tell you will you promise me that he'll go to jail? And I won't ever have to see his face again, that I won't have to face him? I can't promise you that, Hannah.
But I will promise you this: I will do everything in my power to keep you safe and protect you in this process.
But I can't do that unless I know everything that happened.
Like a name.
A name.
Bryce Walker.
Bryce Walker raped Hannah.
If you can't give me a name if you don't want to press charges against this boy if you're not even sure you can press charges then there really is only one option.
What is it? I'm not trying to be blunt here, Hannah, but you can move on.
You mean do nothing.
Is he in your class? He's a senior.
That means he'll be gone in a few months.
Are you fucking kidding me? It can be very dangerous to accuse someone of a crime like that.
I have his confession.
How do you have his confession? I asked him for it.
I took Hannah at her word, which is what you should have done.
I believed Hannah, and I accused Bryce of rape, and then he beat the shit out of me and admitted it.
I think maybe now is where we stop this conversation.
- Okay.
All right.
- Yeah.
But wouldn't you like to know what happened after Hannah left that day? Look, something happened, Hannah.
And I believe you.
But if you won't confront him then the only other choice is to move on.
Yeah.
That's just what I'm going to have to do.
Thank you, Mr.
Porter.
Okay.
There's more to talk about, other resources.
No, I think we figured it out.
I need to move on and get over it.
Hannah, I didn't say get over it.
But sometimes that's the only other option.
Look, you're right.
I know.
Hey, Hannah, you can sit down.
You don't need to be in a hurry.
I need to get on with things.
If things aren't going to change, I'd better get on with it.
Hey, Hannah.
She walked out of this office and she hoped you would come after her.
Okay.
I can have that for you His door is closed behind me.
Right.
Yes, sir.
- But you didn't.
- Okay.
Excellent.
He's not coming.
I think I've made myself very clear but no one's coming forward to stop me.
Some of you care.
None of you cared enough.
Neither did I.
And I'm sorry.
So it's the end of tape 13.
There's nothing more to say.
You let her walk away.
We all let her walk away.
She walked out of school went home and put some things in order.
She returned her uniform to the Crestmont, where I worked with her.
She didn't say anything.
She dropped it on the counter and walked away.
She dropped a package off with a friend, then took another to the post office.
Hannah.
Oh.
Hey.
Robert.
Hi.
So good to see you.
We've missed you.
- You have? - At the group.
Linda even wrote a poem about it.
Oh, well, um - I don't really write poetry anymore.
- That's too bad.
Well, come visit sometime anyway, okay? - Yeah.
Okay.
- Don't be a stranger.
Then she went back home put on some old clothes.
She went into the bathroom filled the tub opened the box of razor blades she took from her parents' store that morning She got into the tub still with her clothes on slit her wrists and bled to death.
And she died alone.
Hannah? Why is the water still running? There's water all over the floor.
Hannah, come on.
Oh.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
Come on, honey, it's okay.
Come on, baby.
Hannah? Oh, sweetheart.
Come on.
Come on, honey.
It's okay.
Andy! Come on, you're okay.
You're gonna be fine.
Andy! Come on, honey, it's okay, you're fine.
Oh, God! Oh, Hannah! No, no! She's okay, she's okay.
- Call 9-1-1.
Call 9-1-1! - Oh, God.
Don't touch me, just call 9-1-1.
Tell them to hurry! Tell them to hurry! And you could have stopped it.
And I could have.
Justin Foley could have.
And a dozen other people, at least.
But we didn't.
It's powerful.
And painful.
Just to imagine what Hannah's last days were.
To try to understand what led her there.
But if she wanted to end her life we weren't going to stop her.
I cost a girl her life because I was afraid to love her.
You can't love someone back to life.
You can try.
Clay we don't know what was in her mind or in her heart.
There's no way to know why she did what she did.
Actually, there is a way.
Before she died Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.
And you're number 13.
And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.
And they always will.
And they'll know what they did.
You're the last person to get the tapes.
Hannah didn't leave any instructions on what happens after you so you get to decide.
And I added tape number 14 which I hope will help you make that decision.
How do you have these tapes? I'm number 11.
It has to get better.
The way we treat each other and look out for each other.
It has to get better somehow.
Skye.
Hey, Skye.
What? Hey, uh How's it going? Uh Fine.
Why? Listen, I was, um I was wondering if you wanted to, like hang out sometime? Okay.
When? How about now? How about we walk right out those doors and hang out for a while? Are you okay? No.
Is that all right? Yeah.
That's fine.
Tyler, honey, it's time to go.
Tyler? Are you in there? Just a second.
Tyler, honey, it's time to go.
Tyler.
Tyler.
Mom.
Privacy.
I was calling for you.
We're gonna be late.
Sorry.
I was just grabbing a sweater.
Your dad is on his way from work.
Are you sure you don't want Mr.
Sebring to meet us there? Mom I didn't do anything wrong.
I don't need a lawyer.
I just worry.
Those kids are already picking on you.
If you have to talk about them Don't worry, Mom.
I can take care of myself.
We should go.
They said this afternoon's session starts at two sharp.
Andy, what's this? It's nothing.
It's an application for Walplex.
Their pharmacy's open till eleven.
I can do night shifts.
No.
Absolutely not.
This case could go on for a long time, Liv.
Mrs.
Baker.
Tony, what What are you what is it? I, uh I have to apologize for not telling you everything.
Hannah asked me to keep secrets for her.
I wanted to honor that.
But I've come to believe I need to share something with you.
There are 14 audio files on there.
You should listen to them in order.
I have the original tapes, and for reasons you'll come to understand, I have them hidden somewhere very safe.
But if you need those, I will bring them to you too.
What's on here? What kind of files? I I really think you should just listen.
What happened to Hannah I wish that would never happen to any other kid, ever.
And if giving you this helps that, then I'm sorry.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
We're going to be late.
I would say that the climate at Liberty High School as I have experienced it myself, is bad.
I get shit every I'm sorry.
It's fine, Tyler.
Just use your own words.
I get shit every day.
People trip me and slam me into walls.
Lock me in the bathroom stalls and pull my pants down.
And do you know if Hannah Baker experienced bullying like this? Again, Dennis asks for an expert opinion.
Did you ever hear anyone at Liberty speak unkindly to Hannah? Yes.
Can you tell me about the time or times that happened? It happened all the time.
Guys would call her a slut and say that she's easy, that sort of stuff.
Did you ever witness anyone being physically abusive to Hannah? - I bet it happened.
- Dennis.
Tyler, we have to ask you not to speculate.
Just talk about what you actually witnessed.
I saw how guys treated her.
I have pictures of it.
You have pictures of physical abuse? You have proof? No, no, not physical abuse, but Okay, let's, uh talk about There are tapes.
I'm sorry? There are tapes.
Hannah recorded tapes.
She talked about what happened to her.
And where are these tapes now? Last I heard, Clay Jensen had them.
Are you sure about that, Tyler? Last I heard.
Well, Dennis, without the tapes in evidence, I'd suggest we move on.
Hello? Miss Davis, it's important that you speak only to what you actually experienced.
Okay? So, you and Hannah were friends? Yeah.
For a while.
What do you mean "for a while"? We stopped being friends.
Can you tell me why you think that happened? 'Cause I slapped her.
And why did you slap her? Because I thought she was fooling around with my boyfriend.
And why did you think that? Because Because guys talk at our school.
And they do sh They do things to girls that no one ever talks about and no one ever does anything about.
Things like what, Miss Davis? Like what do you think? Be helpful if you could tell me.
Miss Davis, I know this is difficult, but it's important you tell us.
- Argumentative.
- Hardly argumentative.
Dennis.
Don't force her to answer.
Okay.
Okay, Miss Davis.
Uh, do you know anything about tapes that Hannah recorded about what happened to her? No.
When did you go to vodka? Since I needed to travel.
Whoa, no, no, no.
You promised me a drink.
They got you going to the lawyers today? I didn't go.
Good.
Good.
How did Jensen know? About me and Hannah Baker? Hannah Baker made these tapes before she died.
Saying what we all did to her.
What you did.
To Jessica.
To Jessica? She was in the room that night.
Hiding.
You've heard these tapes? Yeah.
I'm on 'em too.
And who has them now? At this point, I don't know.
Jesus.
But who's gonna believe a dead girl, right? I guess we'll find out.
Justin.
Justin.
You know the real story, right? You know what's true.
I do now.
So I'll see you around? Nah, I don't think you will.
You did great today, kiddo.
You did your friend proud.
Thanks.
You okay? Fine.
Yeah? You don't look fine.
Daddy? I need to tell you Something happened.
To me.
Fucking leave her alone.
These are thousand dollar cameras.
And I'll break 'em on your face.
Jesus, Montgomery, leave him alone.
One last try.
I'm giving life one last try.
Kevin.
Alex Standall shot himself in the head last night.
He's in critical condition at Mercy.
Here we go.
Hey.
It's Hannah.
Hannah Baker.
Good God.
That's right.
Don't adjust your whatever device you're hearing this on.
It's me, live and in stereo.
No return engagements, no encore So, what happens next? I don't know.
I guess we'll find out.
Should I put a tape on? How about we just listen to the radio? That's a great idea.
