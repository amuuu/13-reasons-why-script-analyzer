# "13 Reasons Why" Script Analyzer
This program analyzes "13 Reasons Why" series' first season's scripts and makes a word cloud of the things said in it the most. The results can be helpful to us to help sucidal people and makes us find out whether someone may refer to suicide in his/her talks.

### Run
Just download or clone this project and run this command:
```
python main.py
```
I got the scripts from [here.](https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=13-reasons-why-2017&episode=s01e01)
I used [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) and [wordcloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) library.
